We are committed to annually produce over 1 million crossties. Our machines and processing lines are new, but our expertise is not. Cahaba has a long history in hardwood production. Our return to high quality and high volume production will provide railroads with an assured supply base. Customers can choose from a variety of species, sizes, and treatments.

Hardwood sawmills are key members of our manufacturing system. Our trucks deliver to customers and then can return with a load of "green" ties for our plant.
