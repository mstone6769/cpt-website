Timber piling is an excellent choice for foundation, land, fresh water, or marine applications. Our treatment options match the expected end usage exposure to decay. The specification can be ASTM or your own custom standards. Just let us know the butt, tip, and type of treatment, when you want them—we will do the rest.

Timber piling offers a natural taper of about 1” every 10 feet. This increases friction capacity. They can be brought right to the jobsite on our self unloading trucks. We will work with you to produce piling in advance of your driving schedule and then maintain delivery per your needs.
