We produce Southern Pine poles to meet or exceed American National Standards Institute Specification 05.1 latest revision for size and quality. Our production of select only Pine begins with our Forestry Department, who works closely with our many timber suppliers to mark and harvest "pole quality" timber.

Southern Pine is the dominant species for wood poles in the country and for good reason. It is plentiful in most sizes, and once properly dried, treats very well.
