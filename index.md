Wood poles — what could be more common and ordinary?  Everywhere you look, they hold up our electric, telephone, and internet lines.   Millions upon millions are in use around the world.  Yet, there is a vitality and dynamic to their story that is worth learning about.

What reason would a customer have for wanting our poles and services?   Those questions are answered here.
