<p>Cahaba’s mission is to produce pressure treated wood products in very high volumes in a safe, efficient, and proper manner. The primary focus is on wood poles produced to quality standards and shipped on whatever schedule our customers request. The highest priority is to maintain our end user’s system reliability.</p>
<p>The facts speak for themselves — we all rely on electricity, electricity relies on overhead lines, wood poles are the most efficient system for most lines. These facts make overhead line reliability essential. Anyone responsible for overhead line design, construction, and maintenance should know about and have access to Cahaba's production capacity. Why is that true? Cahaba is the <strong>largest treating plant</strong> in the world. Our production capacity, industry commitments, and quality dedication make us the first choice in wood pole supply.</p>
<p>As we enter our 47th year of continuous business and growth, we can offer thanks to our founders, our hard working staff, our loyal suppliers, and to our many customers.</p>
<p>Cahaba began when two brothers—Kermit and Joseph Stephens decided to build and operate a hardwood sawmill near our present site. The year was 1964. Capital investment was limited, but hard work was not. Largely through their inspired work ethic, the company began to grow. Very early on, a guiding principle was “set in stone” for all company employees to follow. Mr. Kermit stated in direct terms—“if we say it will be done, we will do it”. The company has now established a long history of fulfilling orders on time and to specifications.</p>
<p>After the company was successful in the hardwood industry, creosote cylinders were built to offer pressure treated railroad crossties and timbers. The company was asked to add round products in the mid 70’s. Slowly, poles supplanted crossties as the companies’ main products. New preservative cylinders offering pentachlorophenol (penta), CCA, and later Copper Naphthenate completed the treatment options. Production increased dramatically with the addition of a pole framing building, followed by a second even larger one. In 2009, a new log “merchandiser” was installed. The company now offers a full selection of poles, piling, posts, and other custom products.</p>

They are ready, willing, and able to produce wood poles around the clock if need be to get the power restored for our customers. Their dedication is very much appreciated by the owners. Through recessions, economic slowdowns, and just uncertain times, our “family” has remained together. The owners made a commitment to the staff—during the entire time of our company—there has never been anyone laid off for lack of work. We take care of our “family”! They will take care of our customers!</h2>
<p>layout: about title: Sustainability permalink: /about/sustainability/ ---</p>
<p>Wood poles are produced only from highly renewable Southern Pine plantations. Far more trees are planted each year than are harvested.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pine uses very little energy to grow.</li>
<li>Our forests provide shelter for wildlife and recreational opportunities for us all.</li>
<li>There is very little waste as the bark, trims, and chips are all used.</li>
<li>Pine captures and holds carbon as it is releasing oxygen into the atmosphere.</li>
<li>Unlike steel poles, wood requires very little energy to produce into a finished product.</li>
<li><h2 id="most-wood-poles-can-be-recycled-into-other-products-or-energy.">Most wood poles can be recycled into other products or energy.</h2>
layout: about title: Operations permalink: /about/operations/ ---</li>
</ul>
<p>Located in the heart of the “Pine Belt”, our forests provide a perfect base from which our foresters can select trees meeting pole standards.</p>
<p>Only a small percentage of standing timber will meet our standards, so they must work diligently with our quality timber suppliers to assure a steady stream of “barkies” to our mill. We operate two pole peeling machines, four large dry kilns, and two framing buildings. This allows us to process over 2000 poles per day to any specifications required. Our pressure treating plants consist of the following cylinders:</p>
<p><strong>Penta:</strong></p>
<p>2 -- 8’ x 147’</p>
<p>1 – 8’ x 130’</p>
<p><strong>Creosote:</strong></p>
<p>1 – 8’ x 125’</p>
<p>1 – 6’ x 80’</p>
<p>2 – 6’ x 36’</p>
<p><strong>CuNap:</strong></p>
<p>1 – 8 x 80’</p>
<p>1 – 8 x 47’</p>
<p><strong>CCA:</strong></p>
<p>1 – 8’ x 150’</p>

<p>layout: different title: High Volume Means Fast Shipments permalink: /different/high-volume-fast-shipments/ --- Overhead lines are subject to severe weather, which can result in power outages. Our focus then becomes single-minded—do whatever it takes to supply wood poles to our customers so their customers have power back as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Here is why major utilities have Cahaba in their supply chain:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Production goes around the clock when needed</li>
<li>Entire staff lives close to the plant</li>
<li>24 hour emergency number</li>
<li>Thousands of poles in stock at all times</li>
<li>Immediate shipment from our treated stock</li>
<li>Two production lines under cover</li>
<li>Two pole peelers on site, and four more off site</li>
<li>Dozens of untreated (white stock) suppliers ship to us</li>
<li>Four preservatives options- CCA, Penta, Creosote, CuNap</li>
<li>Seven active cylinders and three in reserve</li>
<li>Four huge dry kilns and four more off site</li>
<li>Company trucks always ready to roll</li>
</ul>
<p>Within a short two hour notice, our plant can begin shipments of over 2000 poles per day --- layout: different title: Large Variety of Sizes permalink: /different/large-variety-of-sizes/ --- The fact that many customers use the most common sizes of poles can be a challenge for most pole plants. We have solved that problem.</p>
<p>Need 1000 class 4/40’s next week? Need 100 class 1/75’s? We can ship them and more—without interfering with normal deliveries. Our plant is a site to behold. Please watch our short video to help explain our point.</p>

Our production efficiency requires a steady demand base, so we seek out consistent shipment opportunities. A steady flow of material keeps the stock fresh. Our staff comes in each day with a base load of production. Our material and chemical suppliers know we will require their support. These facts all add up to a solid base from which to operate. That base then allows us to offer specialized sizes, products, and shipments. It also allows us to ramp up production to meet extra needs.</h2>

<p>layout: product title: Agriculture Products permalink: /products/agriculture-products/ --- A post is a post is a post—or so many in our industry would claim. Our posts are made in a superior manner. They are the tops of our “full length” barkies. Our foresters select the entire tree, and our loggers cut them extra long. The longer material then passes through our new log merchandiser. Poles are cut out and the tops become high quality posts. Try a load and find out why our posts are a better choice.</p>

<p>layout: product title: Bio Mass permalink: /products/bio-mass/ --- We are part of this important emerging economic power source. Biomass is plant matter containing solar energy. The plants and trees have converted sunlight into mass which contains carbon for energy. The Southern Pine forest industry is capable of providing vast amounts of biomass as a major step towards renewable energy for our country. Cahaba is a vital part of this emerging supply base. Our forest maintainance programs result in healthy trees by thinning and select harvesting. This well managed process produces vast amounts of wood fiber from small trees and logging residue. We do not waste wood fiber—we convert it to biomass.</p>
<p>Alabama and our surrounding supply regions offer an ever growing abundance of wood fiber. More trees are planted each year than are harvested. It takes almost no energy to grow and harvest pine trees. The forests are carbon neutral and contain 50% carbon. Pine biomass is part of the solution, and Cahaba is an excellent source of biomass. Whether you need a few loads or are seeking a long term commitment, let us be your source.</p>
