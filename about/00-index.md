Cahaba’s mission is to produce pressure treated wood products in very high volumes in a safe, efficient, and proper manner. The primary focus is on wood poles produced to quality standards and shipped on whatever schedule our customers request. The highest priority is to maintain our end user’s system reliability.

The facts speak for themselves — we all rely on electricity, electricity relies on overhead lines, wood poles are the most efficient system for most lines. These facts make overhead line reliability essential. Anyone responsible for overhead line design, construction, and maintenance should know about and have access to Cahaba's production capacity. Why is that true? Cahaba is the **[largest treating plant]({{ "/about/plant/" | prepend: site.baseurl }} "Our Plant Site")** in the world. Our production capacity, industry commitments, and quality dedication make us the first choice in wood pole supply.
