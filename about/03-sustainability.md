Wood poles are produced only from highly renewable Southern Pine plantations. Far more trees are planted each year than are harvested.

* Pine uses very little energy to grow.
* Our forests provide shelter for wildlife and recreational opportunities for us all.
* There is very little waste as the bark, trims, and chips are all used.
* Pine captures and holds carbon as it is releasing oxygen into the atmosphere.
* Unlike steel poles, wood requires very little energy to produce into a finished product.
* Most wood poles can be recycled into other products or energy.
