Located in the heart of the “Pine Belt”, our forests provide a perfect base from which our foresters can select trees meeting pole standards.

Only a small percentage of standing timber will meet our standards, so they must work diligently with our quality timber suppliers to assure a steady stream of “barkies” to our mill. We operate two pole peeling machines, four large dry kilns, and two framing buildings. This allows us to process over 2000 poles per day to any specifications required. Our pressure treating plants consist of the following cylinders:

**Penta:**

2 -- 8’ x 147’

1 – 8’ x 130’

**Creosote:**

1 – 8’ x 125’

1 – 6’ x 80’

2 – 6’ x 36’

**CuNap:**

1 – 8 x 80’

1 – 8 x 47’

**CCA:**

1 – 8’ x 150’

1 – 6’ x 90’
