Overhead lines are subject to severe weather, which can result in power outages. Our focus then becomes single-mindedâ€”do whatever it takes to supply wood poles to our customers so their customers have power back as soon as possible.

##Here is why major utilities have Cahaba in their supply chain:

* Production goes around the clock when needed
* Entire staff lives close to the plant
* 24 hour emergency number
* Thousands of poles in stock at all times
* Immediate shipment from our treated stock
* Two production lines under cover
* Two pole peelers on site, and four more off site
* Dozens of untreated (white stock) suppliers ship to us
* Four preservatives options- CCA, Penta, Creosote, CuNap
* Seven active cylinders and three in reserve
* Four huge dry kilns and four more off site
* Company trucks always ready to roll

Within a short two hour notice, our plant can begin shipments
of over 2000 poles per day
