The fact that many customers use the most common sizes of poles can be a challenge for most pole plants. We have solved that problem.

Need 1000 class 4/40’s next week? Need 100 class 1/75’s? We can ship them and more—without interfering with normal deliveries. Our plant is a site to behold. Please watch our short video to help explain our point.

Small plants cannot solve large problems. Cahaba can take on the largest orders in the industry and ship them on time, every time. We maintain a consistent inventory of over 30,000 poles. We have thousands more available from key suppliers. Let us show you what we can do. It only takes one storm for any utility to want Cahaba in the pipeline.
