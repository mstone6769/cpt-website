New customers are appreciated and become part of our commitment.
Long term customers know they will receive the attention they deserve.

We have relationships of over 30 years. Our production efficiency requires a steady demand base, so we seek out consistent shipment opportunities. A steady flow of material keeps the stock fresh. Our staff comes in each day with a base load of production. Our material and chemical suppliers know we will require their support. These facts all add up to a solid base from which to operate. That base then allows us to offer specialized sizes, products, and shipments. It also allows us to ramp up production to meet extra needs.
