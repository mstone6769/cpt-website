* Pentachlorophenol
* Creosote
* CCA (please visit [www.cahabatimber.com](http://www.cahabatimber.com "CCA Wood Pole Supplier"))
* Copper Naphthenate

Each one offers some advantages and each one may have some perceived disadvantages to certain end users. All four meet AWPA standards. All four offer years of service. It is not our position of insist that a customer only use a certain preservative. Choice is better.

We are the only plant offering all four commercial preservatives from one location. Our customers can “test out” another preservative at anytime. We will place a few on a load, or make a complete shipment. Our customers get the preservative of their choice.
